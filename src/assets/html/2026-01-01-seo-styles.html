        <h1 class=blog-title>Site SEO + Styles</h1><p class="blog-paragraph">HAPPY NEW YEARS 🎉🎉🎉<br>
Sorry I didn&#39;t post, kinda either forgot or it was too close to my bedtime, I&#39;ll get back on the grind. That&#39;s not to say I didn&#39;t work on this project though. The work I did was quite a bit, although it takes a few words to explain. I keep forgetting to order the parts for the project, mostly because I don&#39;t know <em>what</em> to order (posted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRobotics/comments/1q1ba4b/power_source_structure/">reddit question</a>, help if you can).</p><h2 class=blog-subtitle>Website SEO</h2><p class="blog-paragraph">Firstly, if you look at the top of your site, you should see a nice, elegant URL. Should along the lines of <code>/post/</code>, followed by a glamourous slug (in this case <code>seo-styles</code>). This is better for SEO than just the raw HTML filenames as before. The way I made this URL was through Angular routing (god I love Angular).</p><h3 class=blog-extra>SEO</h3><p class="blog-paragraph">So basically I had to change my last setup (which was a bunch of html files stored in a folder), to one that has each component as a page. This was kinda hard though, because the way I go about blog posts is as such: first, I write in markdown because it&#39;s easy to use and visualize, second I run a script that turns it into HTML, third I use Angular&#39;s HTTP library to get the HTML from my filesystem. So like, if my sites are in HTML files, how am I supposed to turn them into components?<br></p><p class="blog-paragraph">The way I did it was by first creating a <code>blog-post</code> component, and then in the component&#39;s template (aka the html for the component) I put a <code>div</code>, and property binded the attribute <code>innerHTML</code> to a signal containing my actual blog&#39;s HTML. Like so:</p><pre><code>&lt;div [innerHTML]=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p class="blog-paragraph">For all you non angular users, I&#39;ll dumbify it: a signal is a reactive variable, when it changes everything else using it changes; property binding is just if you have an attribute in HTML and you want it to connect to a variable (like <code>innerHTML</code> connects to <code>content</code>)<br></p><h3 class=blog-extra>Styling</h3><p class="blog-paragraph">Yeah I just let my copilot in VSCode just write it out. Nothing to it, just a <code>tab</code>. These are just placeholder styles though, it&#39;s a mere shadow of what it&#39;s going to look like</p><h2 class=blog-subtitle>Ending</h2><p class="blog-paragraph">I did my blog before dinner! That&#39;s time-management and responsibility right there. Starting off 2026 semi-strong. Good night, good morning, and good whatever else&#39;s outside your window.</p>
