            <p>Didn't work on the website again, only the car. I don't feel too mad about this though because this is the good part of the project. If you don't already know, I am working on: 1. this blog post you're reading as a side project, and 2. an electrical smart car using Arduinos and Raspberry Pis</p>

            <p>Last time, the car wasn't moving because I was mixing up Python (from me coding with the Pi), and C++ (from the Arduino). In the code, I put `delay(0.5)` for the duration of spinning the motors (on the Arduino). Then I realized the parameter for delay is in MILLISECONDS; I thought it was seconds because `time.sleep()` in Python takes seconds.</p>

                <section aria-label="Controller">
                    <header>
                        <h3>Controller</h3>
                    </header>
            <p>So after I tested all the motors, made sure they all work, double-checked the car can go forward, backward, left, and right, I wanted a controller from the Pi. I was thinking an end-goal should be to put it on a website, but for now I decided that the terminal was fine. Somehow, I wanted to input WASD like you would in a game. First on the Pi, I tried to use the `keyboard` module, it didn't work for some reason related to me using VNC Viewer instead of HDMI. Then I tried to use `curses`, it felt a little too low level (which is fine, I worked with a lot of low level stuff) but it felt jarring because it was Python, and even `curses` didn't work. So then, I just jumped right into the website, using Flask to use Python as my backend. This did work. I lied, it didn't, but it has the potential to work. It's just a problem of Flask and my Python aren't communicating too good, but it's just a regular programming thing, not anything serious.</p>
            <p>But I did get worried about my testing habits. What I am about to explain, take it as a bad example. First, as I was testing, I repeatedly rammed it into a box and just left it there while I tried to fix the bug. It did shut off eventually, but only because the motors draw more and more current the more they need it and they eventually have stoppers to shut them off after a certain point. Repeatedly, not good at all. Secondly, the wire connecting the Raspberry Pi to the wall (for power) was getting tugged on, they are delicate electronics people. Thirdly, I didn't code in a point where the motors should stop. There should _always_ be code for the motors to stop otherwise every part of your project could get fried. Finally fourthly, the Pi didn't have any airflow because I just double sided taped it onto the cardboard. Yeah so when I ChatGPT'd all this, I got scared and stopped working for the day. I do have a case for the Pi and a fan, but the negative wire on the fan broke off and now I have to buy a new one.</p>
            <p>Either from now until the new parts come, I'll be working on the website or on other parts of the project (such as the camera, I plan to put it on a servo to pan around). Another option is I could _actually_ work on this website. I don't know, maybe both.</p>

            <p>It's 8:44, trying to sleep before my bedtime. Good night, good morning, good everything else to anyone else. Brother, watch out (who _actually_ calls their brother _brother_ though? I'm just using brother just because I don't want to post his name).</p>
