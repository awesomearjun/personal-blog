<p>First I&#39;ll talk about the electrical project I&#39;m working on, then my changes to this site.</p>
<h2>Electrical project</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t talk about it last time, but I&#39;ve been trying to make a smart car. I have made an electrical car in the past using Arduino + Gear motors + Adafruit motor shield, and now I want to remake that project since recently I have got a Raspberry PI (it&#39;s really good btw). The smart features I want to add are cameras, maybe a screen, and other random components I can find in my electrical bin.</p>
<p>If you read this post&#39;s description, you would&#39;ve seen I said, &quot;I also made an electrical project to make Raspberry PI + Arduino talk and move gear motors around&quot; (Me, 2025, literally 2 minutes ago, it&#39;s important to credit your quotes guys). Now, if you know a speck of dust about Arduinos and Raspberry PIs, you would realize that they <em>BOTH</em> can control motors. You might be asking why I need 2 &quot;microcontrollers&quot; (in quotes because PIs aren&#39;t microcontrollers aparently according to ChatGPT) to control something that <em>BOTH</em> can control, the answer is that my motor shield only works for Arduino and I don&#39;t want to get a specific alternative for my PI. The solution I thought of is just to use <em>BOTH</em> of them (both counter in this one paragraph: 3).</p>
<p>I remember when I was trying to search for specific tutorials on how to use the PI when I was <em>really</em> starting out, I saw one that taught how to use Arduinos AND Raspberry PIs. I had glossed over it since I just wanted to use a PI, but I got a flashback to that course when I had this problem. So, I rummaged the internet on how to use Arduinos and Raspberry PIs in unison (spoiler alert: it&#39;s pretty easy).</p>
<p>How it works is by understanding a tiny part of Arduinos: its ability to read and write to serial. The serial works through the cable that connects the Arduino to a device via USB, and lo and behold the Raspberry PI has a USB port. All I did on the Arduino was read from serial, write back saying that it recived the message (for debug purposes), and just move the gear motors.</p>
<p>When I tested it, the motors moved brilliantly, no bugs, but all my wires got tangled because I just ran it without any support and now I&#39;m scared to run it again. I also could only find 3 out of 4 of my old gear motors, so now we&#39;re building a 3 wheeled car!</p>

<h2>Website</h2>
<h3>Parser</h3>
<p>I actually completed some of my day 1 aspirations pretty quickly. For one, I made a site parser. Right now, I&#39;m writing in a markdown file because it&#39;s easy to use, and I have a VSCode extension to preview how my text looks like. But the problem is, you can&#39;t exactly put raw markdown on a website (at least, not to my knowledge, and even if you can there&#39;s a ton of HTML features I don&#39;t want to miss out on, like styling). So what I did was I made a parser that parses my markdown files and converts them to HTML.</p>
<p>It was actually pretty easy, thanks to the extensive NodeJS community. I used mainly two libraries for this: <code>marked</code>, and <code>gray-matter</code>. Marked is the library that just converts my markdown into HTML. You might be thinking that that&#39;s all that needs to happen, but no. I want to have metadata too just for some other ideas I have in mind. At the time of typing, you will be able to see a fieldset with a legend called &quot;Metadata&quot; with all the data in there. What metadata you may ask? This metadata:</p>

<h3>JSON</h3>
<p>Basically, in the frontend you can&#39;t really access files unless they are JSON. So instead of going through my directory of all my blog posts, I just put their paths in a file called <code>sites.json</code> and put that in my <code>public</code> directory so Angular is happy. Yes I am using Angular for this project, and yes I know I said it&#39;s supposed to be a side project, and yes I know Angular is mainly for large teams, but damn Angular is fun to use. I never liked web development, more of a guy who craves action like in game dev or electrical dev, but Angular is some of the most fun I&#39;ve had making websites. It just makes sense. In fact, I&#39;m having a hard time keeping this a side project. To be fair, I didn&#39;t do too much Angular dev yet, just this backend stuff, but I am excited for the Angular dev part and I don&#39;t want to jinx it.</p>
<h3>Site Generator</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t want to type in a bunch of boilerplate every time I&#39;m trying to make a blog post, so I just automated it! I made a shell script that does just that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">#!/bin/zsh

# sorry windows and linux users, this is for mac only womp womp
read &quot;?Enter filename title: &quot; title
filename=&quot;$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-${title}.md&quot;
touch &quot;$filename&quot;
echo &quot;Created: $filename&quot;
echo &quot;---
title: ${title}
date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
description: &lt;description&gt;
---
# &lt;site-title&gt;&quot; &gt; &quot;$filename&quot;
echo &quot;Filled in template content.&quot;
mv &quot;$filename&quot; &quot;posts/markdown/&quot;
echo &quot;Moved to posts/markdown directory.&quot;
echo &quot;Done! Access at posts/markdown/$filename&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you Claude built into VSCode for about 99% of this code. Yes I&#39;m a Mac user and no I don&#39;t care about Linux and Windows. If you want to use this code for some reason, you have ChatGPT to help convert it. It&#39;s just me on this project and I&#39;m not trying to go unnessasarily overkill to make sure it works for Mac, and Windows, and all the 500,000+ distros of Linux. If you&#39;re someone important reading this, and I&#39;m applying for something and I gave you this website to show you what I did, this is all just humour I have the ability to make it Windows and Linux compatible I&#39;m just tactically focusing my efforts into the entire rest of the website, strategically overlooking this menial task.</p>
<h2>Bye bye</h2>
<p>Yep that&#39;s it bye bye have a good day nothing else to this. It&#39;s late gotta sleep. Good night if night, good morning if morning, and good everything else.</p>
