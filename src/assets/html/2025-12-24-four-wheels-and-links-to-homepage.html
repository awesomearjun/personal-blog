            <p>Guys, I have sad news 😔...
My parser is broken 😭</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t already know, I am working on my main project to be a smart car using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Last time, I talked about how I figured out how to make them both communicate. My side project (which is slowly becoming my main) is this website, and last time I talked about how I got my a markdown to HTML parser to work (but now it doesn&#39;t).</p>

                    <h2>Electrical Project</h2>
                </header><p>Aside from the bad news at the top, I also found my 4th gear motor so now I have a quad-wheeled car! I just realized right now a bug in my Raspberry Pi Program as I&#39;m writing this, basically the thing about having 4 wheels is that my back motors and one way and my front motors are another, so this means I might have to move my back wheels forwards and front wheels backwards to move the car forward. I was also too scared to test it because last time my wires tangled (it doesn&#39;t have a proper structure yet) so that&#39;s all I did physically.</p>
<p>Later, I was just thinking about how to power my car, because I can&#39;t just have it wired right now it moves. Theres two parts to this: powering my Raspberry Pi, and powering my motors (I don&#39;t need to power my Arduino because the Raspberry Pi is connected to it via cable, and that&#39;s okay because they will be moving in unison). After this, I was wondering how I could make the Raspberry Pi run a script when it&#39;s not wired, since it has an operating system on it and right now I have to manually do <code>python &lt;myscript&gt;</code>, and turns out it&#39;s pretty easy. All you have to do is just edit a file to say to run this script when the OS boots.</p>

                <header>
                    <h2>Blog website</h2>
                </header><p>As I was saying, my parser broke. A moment of silence... Don&#39;t get it wrong, because of my sheer programming skill I did get it to put the HTML links of my blogs onto the homepage, but then I thought &quot;Huh, the links wouldn&#39;t be enough, because I also need all the other metadata to my blogs on the homepage (e.g., the date, the description), so I changed the data type of the parser.</p>
<p>I know it&#39;s hard to just visualize in the air, so I&#39;ll explain how it works a little. So first, I use a library called <code>gray-matter</code> to extract the metadata from my blog post. How does it know the metadata? Well, I code each blog in markdown (because it&#39;s easy to just type), and at the top I put the hidden metadata like this:</p>

            <pre><code>---
title: Four Wheels and Links To Homepage
date: 2025-12-24
description: My car officially has 4 wheels and I put links from my blogs to my homepage
---</code></pre><p>If you&#39;re a true OG (let&#39;s be real, none of you are because this site is only on github not deployed yet), you would see a HTML fieldset with the legend of &quot;Metadata&quot; displaying it all. It&#39;s not going to last though, because that&#39;s just debug info so that I know I <em>have</em> info to put on the homepage.</p>
<p>Back to the data types thing, before all the data in my JSON file (I have one to store all the file links so that I don&#39;t have to manually loop through all the files to find all the sites because filesystem stuff isn&#39;t allowed on the frontend), was only storing the name and link of the website, nothing else (no date, no description). But then I wanted the date and description. I was just typing the data type for this object in raw variable notation, like:</p>

            <pre><code>let post: { [key: string]; string };</code></pre><p>It was going to get messy with all that data, but because I&#39;m coding in TypeScript, I had access to <code>interfaces</code>. I needed multiple files to access the interface, and I knew a simple way to do this was to just make a global module that stores all the global data types etc I need for the project. BUT TYPESCRIPT just wanted to make that complicated and make imports not work good, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m stuck on.</p>

                </header><p>Sorry for the bad writing, I do feel kinda guilty that if someone other than me is <em>actually</em> reading this, it&#39;s going to be hard to understand. But I am doing this just to track my progress, and it is a side project. It&#39;s a little tricky to time manage this with everything else I wanna do, but I&#39;ll get better. It&#39;s 9:09, my bedtime is 9:30, I got things to do, good night good morning good everything else.</p>
