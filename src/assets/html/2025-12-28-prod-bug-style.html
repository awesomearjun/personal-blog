<p>First of all, if you&#39;re reading this on Github: STOP. The website is working! Find it <a href="https://www.arjuns-blog.vercel.app">here</a>. Sorry if it&#39;s a little ugly cuz of dark mode, working on it!. I didn&#39;t work on car because I need to buy the components now, so I&#39;ve only worked on this website.</p>
<h2>Website</h2>
<p>Didn&#39;t do too much work, more thinking. So here&#39;s a todo list/timeline without times kinda plan for this project: first, I&#39;ll make this site look fairly good. Not any final styles yet (although thinking of some, a mix of a terminal theme and deep blue). Just making sure it works on mobile and computer. Second: SEO. I want this site to go on Google. I will have to install an Angular SEO think, and that requires me to make each site a component (right now they&#39;re just html files). Third: final styles, and fourth: final SEO. Anyways, I&#39;ll explain how I fixed the bug</p>
<h3>Bug fix</h3>
<p>So what was happening is I had an Angular <code>signal</code> for my posts data (it was an array of a map sorta thing, visualize: <code>[ {title: ..., ..., ...}, {}, {} ]) </code>). What I was doing with the signal was I was mutating the array, but APPARENTLY that does NOT make it reactive (the entire purpose of the signal). What you had to do was make a NEW INSTANCE of that Object and set it as the signal. So yeah, I did that and it works</p>
<h2>Ending</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t want to drag this post, felt like I was beating around the bush with the other ones. But yeah, 8:06, want to sleep in my bedtime, no screens for an hour. Good night, good morning, good anything else, bye bye.</p>
