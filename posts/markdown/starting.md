# first blog post!

## What is this?

This is a place for me to store my projects and what I am working on. I need this because:

1. Whenever I have to apply to something or tell someone what I've done, it's hard to remember
2. It's a good motivation to see how I've progressed over the years
3. I want to teach things to people

This is just a side project for now, as I am currently working on other projects. I'll try to post everyday to just make a streak for the sake of it
(also because most of my projects are electrical, so I don't nessasarily post my changes to github and I don't have a green calendar).

## What is coming?

Again, this is just a side project so I don't want too many feature, but I still have to _make_ an okay-ish website to host my blogs.
With that being said, this is what I want to work on:

- A readme parser (so I can just put readmes in the posts directory, and a parser will take this readme and put it to json, then something else
  makes it a webpage; I want readmes because I can easily view how it looks in vscode so I can see if images and stuff work)
- A search bar (nothing too fancy, no binary search, just something to help me reminisce on a project or someone else to see)
- A working angular website (I know angular is overkill for something like this, and I don't even know how to _use_ angular, but I remember
  it being the most fun I've had making a website, I don't even like web development that much!)
- Intro cards to the webpage (on the homepage where I introduce myself, I want a bunch of cards on there with descriptions and maybe images
  on what the post is about, and then it takes you to that post website that the parser created out of readmes)
- A blog creation site (just some website with text boxes where I can organize my thoughts into those boxes and maybe puts it in a readme, or
  I could just put it straight to json or html which in that case I don't need the parser)
- A personal streak calender for me to see how often I posted (again, I want this to be everyday)

For the third time (sorry for repitition), this is a _side_ project _for now_ so I don't want to go overkill on this list.
If you do decide to keep in touch (it's more for me than anyone else), I hope you learn something on this adventure! I'll try to make the blogs
educational!
