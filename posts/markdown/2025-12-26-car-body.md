# Car's body

Guys. I jinxed it 😔. I published the website to vercel yesterday, but none of the sites load on the homepage. It's a really strange bug, because it happens on my computer too, and all I have to do to fix it is just editing the homepage anywhere and deleting the changes and after hot reload does its thing it just shows all the pages. ChatGPT keeps saying the same thing over and over again, didn't do any work on website today, but I did do a lot for my car!

## Car

If you don't already know, I am doing a blog series where I try to make a car using Raspberry Pi and Arduino (Arduino to control the motors, Raspberry Pi to make it smart, no I can't use the Pi to control motors).

### Insight

Before I explain my changes to my car, I would like to share an epiphany I had in the making of the car (it's about where I want to take this project). Before, I didn't know what I was going to do "smart" to the car, but now I have an idea: make it controllable on the web. I can just setup the Pi as a server and port forward the URL (I understand it's never just a "just"). I already have a camera, I can program WASD, and I could put a bunch of other things to fulfill a greater operation: bother the absolute heck out of my brother. I know you're reading this bro, this camera and controls are only going to be the BEST of your annoyances.

### What I actually did

Y'all remember the disfigured motor slump I show'd y'all the last time I showed a photo of this project?

WELL THIS IS HIM NOW

Careful of who you bully in high school guys. I found my fourth wheel, and I add popsicle sticks to make it sturdy. Last time, I explained how I wanted to power this bad boy without any wires. Didn't do that, that's why there's a wire protruding out the left, but I put in a battery for the 'Duino ('Duino sounds like a horrible substitute to Arduino, sorry you had to read that) so it can power the motors. It's a pain putting in the battery because it's such a small space, and I can't keep it plugged forever, but this will have to do. Right now, I use VNC viewer to code on the Pi. Technically, this does control it wirelessly, but I want to dive into using the Pi as a web server. There's a bug that makes it so that the arduino doesn't understand the Serial messages, but once I get it over with it's DONE. He's going to be TOASTED, BURNED, medium rare SEARED.

## Ending

It's almost my bedtime 9:30. Damn, I'm actually so grateful and proud at how this winter break is going. Anyways, good night good morning good anything else outside (idk the word outside just sounded like it felt right to put there, kwim twin?).
